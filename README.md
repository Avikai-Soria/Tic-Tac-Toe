# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

- You are represented by the symbol **X**, and your opponent (either a friend or the computer) is represented by **O**.
- Players take turns placing their marks in empty squares on the grid.
- The first player to achieve a line of 3 marks, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, is declared the winner.
- If all 9 squares are filled and no player has a line of 3 marks, the game ends in a tie.
